# HUMap
This is the source code for a simple map and timetable app for the University of Hull; the app shows users where a timetabled event is on the university map.
You can find the compiled app here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cormacdev.map

The map will not display without a Google API key, which you must supply yourself. The API key should be placed in the platform-specific files; instructions here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/map?view=net-maui-8.0#setup
